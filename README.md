# First-Year-Member-Engagement-Renewals
  When a member joins this large warehouse retailer based in Bentonville, AR, at the end of one year their membership will expire. Members must renew their membership to continue to shop at the store. If they do not renew, they are considered as “attrited” (aka churned). Currently the renewal rate for first year (FY) members (members who are in their first year of membership) is around 55%, as compared to all members which is around 85%.  Goal: Determine what drives a first year member to renew.  • Which behaviors drive new members to renew? What does an "ideal" FY member look like? In terms of shopping behavior and attributes.  Input Data: • One cohort of members (e.g. members who joined in Jan 2017) o Indicator of renewal • Point of Sale (POS) data for those members, from join date to DTR date o Item level data for every transaction • Member attributes, join and demographic data • Item/category cross-reference data
